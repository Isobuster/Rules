\% Following rules only work for IsoBuster versions 4.7 and up because
\% \i(), \c() and \e() are unknown to IsoBuster versions lower than 4.7

\% \i(1) assigns this rule ID 1, and this ID is internally assigned to a 'file' that is found based on this rule
\% \c(1) ('c' for 'concatenate') tells this rule to append what it finds to a previously found 'file' with ID 1
\% In other words if the VOB signature is detected, a file will be created with a length up to next found signature
\% but if next found signature is the same (same ID) then instead of creating a new file, the newly found data is appended instead

\i(1)\c(1)\x00\x00\x01\xba\|.VOB

\% \e(1) ('e' for 'eof') is a rule that ends previously found file, if it has ID 1 (in this case)
\% We could have also used \e() (notice no ID) which ends any previously found file, regardless of ID
\% because there's only one type file found based on these rules
\% DVDVIDEO is leading text in *.IFO and *.BUP files, so when an IFO is found, previously found VOB file ends

\e(1)DVDVIDEO
